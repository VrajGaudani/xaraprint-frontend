            <p>
              Due to the custom nature of our print products, orders can only be cancelled within a very limited timeframe after placement, typically before the design approval or before production begins. If you wish to cancel an order, please contact our support team immediately at <a href="mailto:support@xaraprint.com">support@xaraprint.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once an order has entered the production phase, it cannot be cancelled, and no refund will be issued.
            </p>

            <h3 class="card-title text-secondary mb-3">2. Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              As stated in our Terms and Conditions, all custom print orders are non-refundable. Refunds are generally not provided for custom-made products unless there is a manufacturing defect or an error on our part.
            </p>
            <p>
              **Eligible Cases for Refund/Replacement:**
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>**Damaged or Incorrect Items:** If you receive items that are damaged during transit or are incorrect (e.g., wrong product, wrong design not matching approved proof), you must report this within **48 hours of delivery** with proper photo/video proof. Upon verification, we will offer a replacement or a suitable resolution.</li>
              <li>**Manufacturing Defects:** If a product has a clear manufacturing defect that affects its functionality or appearance, please report it within 48 hours of delivery with evidence. We will assess the issue and provide a replacement or credit as deemed appropriate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="card-title text-secondary mb-3">3. Non-Refundable Situations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>**Change of Mind:** We do not offer refunds or exchanges if you simply change your mind about a custom order.</li>
              <li>**Artwork Errors:** We are not responsible for errors in the final product that are present in the artwork approved by the customer. Please review your proofs carefully.</li>
              <li>**Color Variations:** Slight color variations between your screen and the printed product may occur due to different monitor calibrations and printing processes. These are not considered defects.</li>
              <li>**Late Reporting:** Claims reported after the 48-hour window from delivery will not be eligible for refunds or replacements.</li>
            </ul>
